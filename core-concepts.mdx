Understanding these key concepts will help you work effectively with Vers.

## Projects

A **project** is your working directory containing:
- `vers.toml` - Configuration file defining VM specifications
- `.vers/` - Directory storing branch references and metadata (similar to `.git/`)

Create a new project with:
```bash
vers init my-project
```

## Clusters

A **cluster** is your virtual machine environment. When you run `vers up`, Vers creates a cluster based on your `vers.toml` configuration, including:
- Root filesystem (rootfs) 
- Memory allocation
- CPU configuration
- Network setup

```bash
vers up  # Creates cluster + root VM
```

## Virtual Machines (VMs)

VMs are the actual running environments where your work happens. Each VM has:
- **Unique ID**: Auto-generated identifier (e.g., `vm-abc123`)
- **State**: Running, Paused, or Not Started
- **IP Address**: For network access
- **SSH Access**: Connect via `vers connect`

## Branches

**Branches** are named pointers to specific VMs, similar to Git branches. They provide:
- **Human-readable names** instead of VM IDs
- **Current context** tracking via HEAD
- **History management** through the reference system

```bash
vers branch --name feature-test    # Create new branch
vers checkout feature-test         # Switch to branch
vers checkout -c another-branch    # Create and switch
```

## HEAD

**HEAD** represents your current working context - which branch (and therefore which VM) you're currently "on". 

HEAD can point to:
- **A branch reference**: `ref: refs/heads/main` (normal state)
- **A VM directly**: `vm-abc123` (detached HEAD state)

Check your current HEAD:
```bash
vers checkout  # Lists branches, shows current with *
```

## State Inheritance

When you create a branch, **complete state inheritance** occurs:
1. **Parent VM pauses** automatically
2. **Child VM inherits** both filesystem and memory state
3. **Running processes continue** in the child exactly where they left off

This means network connections, open files, and application state all transfer seamlessly.

## Branch Relationships

Vers maintains parent-child relationships between VMs:
- **Parents can have multiple children** (multiple branches from one point)
- **Each child has exactly one parent** (linear inheritance)
- **Deleting requires no children** (`vers kill` only works on leaf nodes)

## Working with Multiple Branches

You can work in multiple branches simultaneously by using different terminal sessions:

```bash
# Terminal 1
vers checkout branch-a
vers connect

# Terminal 2  
vers checkout branch-b
vers connect
```

Both VMs run in parallel, allowing true concurrent testing.

## Configuration Files

### vers.toml
Your project configuration defining:
```toml
[machine]
mem_size_mib = 512
vcpu_count = 1
fs_size_cluster_mib = 1024
fs_size_vm_mib = 512

[rootfs]
name = "default"

[kernel]
name = "default.bin"
```

### .vers Directory Structure
```
.vers/
├── HEAD              # Current branch pointer
├── config            # Repository configuration  
├── refs/
│   └── heads/        # Branch references
│       ├── main      # Points to VM ID
│       └── feature   # Points to VM ID
└── objects/          # Internal storage
```
