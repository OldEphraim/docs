Get up and running with Vers in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux or macOS
- **SSH Client**: Required for connecting to VMs (usually pre-installed)
- **Terminal Access**: Command-line interface

## Install the CLI

### Option 1: Download Binary (Recommended)

This option is under construction.

### Option 2: Build from Source

If you have Go installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hdresearch/vers-cli
cd vers-cli
go build -o vers
sudo mv vers /usr/local/bin/
```

## Verify Installation

Check that Vers is properly installed:

```bash
vers --version
```

You should see version information displayed.

## Authentication

Before using Vers, you'll need to authenticate:

```bash
vers login
```

This will prompt you for your API credentials. If you don't have credentials yet, contact your administrator or sign up for access.

<Info>
The `vers login` command stores your authentication token securely on your local machine. You'll only need to login once per machine.
