**Vers** enables you to create branching virtual machines that capture both filesystem and memory state, allowing you to explore multiple execution paths without starting over.

## The Problem

Traditional development and testing workflows force you to make irreversible decisions. When testing web applications, you might spend minutes navigating to a complex form, only to realize you need to test multiple scenarios from that same point. Usually, this means starting over from scratch every time.

## The Solution

Vers lets you **branch your virtual machine** at any point, creating parallel execution paths that inherit the exact state of their parent. Think of it like Git, but for entire running systems instead of just code.

```bash
# Navigate to your test scenario
vers connect  # SSH into VM, run your setup

# At a decision point, create branches
vers branch --name success-path
vers branch --name error-path  

# Test both scenarios in parallel
vers checkout success-path
vers connect  # Test the success case

vers checkout error-path  
vers connect  # Test the error case
```

## Key Benefits

**Time Savings**: Set up complex scenarios once, then branch to test multiple paths without repeating setup work.

**True Parallelism**: Run multiple test scenarios simultaneously across different terminal sessions.

**State Preservation**: Both filesystem changes and memory state are captured, so running processes continue exactly where they left off.

**Familiar Interface**: Git-like commands (`branch`, `checkout`, `HEAD`) make the learning curve minimal.

## Common Use Cases

**Web Testing**: Navigate to a complex form, then branch to test different input combinations without re-navigation.

**A/B Testing**: Fork your application state to compare different user flows side-by-side.

**Debugging**: Create branches at suspected problem points to test different debugging approaches.

**Development**: Experiment with risky changes while keeping a safe fallback state.

## How It Works

Vers manages clusters of virtual machines that can be branched like Git commits. When you branch a VM, the parent automatically pauses and the child inherits its complete state - both files and memory. This means running processes, network connections, and application state all transfer to the new branch.
